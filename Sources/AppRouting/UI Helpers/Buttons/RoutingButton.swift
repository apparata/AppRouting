/// Convenience button that wraps an `@Environment` for providing
/// the router instance, corresponding to the given ``Routing``, to the action closure.
///
/// **Example:**
///
/// Let's assume that this button is already part of the product list tab.
///
/// ```swift
/// RoutingButton(MainRouting.self) { router in
///     router.push(.productDetails(productID: "12532"))
/// } label: {
///     Text("Details")
/// }
/// .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
/// ```
///
/// If the button is somewhere else, and we want to make sure the correct tab is selected first,
/// we can chain the routing functions.
///
/// ```swift
/// RoutingButton(MainRouting.self) { router in
///     router
///         .select(.productsTab)
///         .push(.productDetails(productID: "12532"))
/// } label: {
///     Text("Details")
/// }
/// .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
/// ```
